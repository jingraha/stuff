## Option 4: Your Own Domain (Advanced)

If you have a domain name:

- Just add your domain in the site settings
- Update your DNS records (they'll give you instructions)

## Tips:
- All these services are **free** for basic hosting
- Your data is saved in browser localStorage, so it stays on each user's computer
- The site works offline once loaded (it's just HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
